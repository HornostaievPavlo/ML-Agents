# ML-Agents
Project implements Unity [package](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents?check_logged_in=1) for machine learning agents.

Created from assets of official [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/course/ml-agents-hummingbirds) from Unity Learn portal.

Aim of project was to to create intelligent flying hummingbirds that can navigate to flowers, dip their beaks in, and drink nectar.
These hummingbirds have six degrees of freedom, meaning they can fly and turn in any direction to find targets. 

Self learning agents were implemented using Reinforcement Learning technique.
